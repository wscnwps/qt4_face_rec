FACE RECOGNITION DEMO
Face detection and alignment are based on dlib[1]. Face feature model is based on LightenedCNN[2] and trained by Caffe[3].

FUNCTION
1. Face register. Register current face in front of the camera into the face repository.
2. Face verification. Specify a name and verifcate the face in front of the camera with the registered faces with the name.
3. Face recognition. Detect face in front of the camera and retrieve its neaest neighbors in the face repository. Also give the similarity of the nearest neighbors.

BUILD
Prerequisite: CMake, Caffe, dlib, QT4, FLANN, Boost, OpenCV
sudo apt install libboost1.xx-dev libflann-dev libqt4-dev libdlib-dev cmake
Install Caffe first, then
    mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j4
Sometimes we need to avoid cuda problem.
    cmake -DCUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

RUN
1. (Download model from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8MDzn0) Aready included.
2. Unzip the model file to source tree.
3. Simple start by
    cd build; ./face_demo
Then you can register face one by one. 
Or you can copy some face images into "images/" directory. One folder for each person. You need to wait for a while with a large number of images.
If any change (add or delete a face) has made, the program will re-index the entire face repository before close. So please wait the program ends itself after press close button. Donot kill the progress, or you may loss the change.
